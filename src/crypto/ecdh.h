 @brief Holds parameters used to generate Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman based secrets
 
  All ECDH secrets are created in two phases. In the first phase, a local key pair and peer public key are used to generate a standard ECDH shared secret, the length of which varies by curve. In the second phase, the ECDH shared secret is expanded by a KDF to get specific length output. The specific KDF and the length of it's output are controlled by the implementation provided by the crypto engine that is used to perform the key exchange operation.
 
 @var wickr_ecdh_params::local_key
 Elliptic Curve key with both public and private components set used to compute the ECDH shared secret
 @var wickr_ecdh_params::peer_key
 Elliptic Curve key with the public component of the other party's key pair used to compute the ECDH shared secret
 @var wickr_ecdh_params::kdf_info
 the kdf parameters to execute against the calculated shared secret, currently supports HKDF
