 Cipher data using the ECDH cipher context
 The cipher operation works as follows:
     1. ECDH is performed with the public and private components of 'ctx->local_key' and the public component
        of 'remote_pub' to create shared_secret
     2. shared_secret is used as input to the kdf function defined by 'kdf_params'. Currently only HKDF is supported
        as a kdf algorithm. Info and Salt parameters can be passed to HKDF via the 'wickr_kdf_meta' properties.
     3. the kdf output is casted into a 'wickr_cipher_key' with cipher type 'ctx->cipher'
     4. the resulting cipher key is used to encrypt 'plaintext', and the result is returned

 @param ctx the ecdh cipher context to use to perform the cipher operation
 @param plaintext the input data to cipher
 @param remote_pub the remote public key to use for the ECDH portion of the operation
 @param kdf_params the kdf parameters to use for the KDF portion of the operation
