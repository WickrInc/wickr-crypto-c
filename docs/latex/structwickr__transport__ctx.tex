\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Transport context to manage the state machine of a point to point connection using fundamentals of the Wickr protocol as building blocks. 

The transport context\textquotesingle{}s operation consists of two phases, a handshake phase where a \mbox{\hyperlink{structwickr__stream__ctx}{wickr\+\_\+stream\+\_\+ctx}} is established in the rx and tx direction using the key exchanges the Wickr messaging protocol operates on, followed by a data transmission phase encoding / decoding packets using the \mbox{\hyperlink{structwickr__stream__ctx}{wickr\+\_\+stream\+\_\+ctx}} objects that are generated by the handshake. This structure does N\+OT handle the actual transport of data, as it\textquotesingle{}s function is to be a state machine that backs a transport such as a T\+CP socket. Note, the \mbox{\hyperlink{structwickr__transport__ctx}{wickr\+\_\+transport\+\_\+ctx}} is it\textquotesingle{}s own standalone tool to do facilitate P2P communcation, it is not used for the Wickr Messaging Protocol itself.
